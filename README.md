# cmake_template
A template project for a C++/C Application using modern cmake

## Introduction
I created this cmake_template to have a fast and easy to use template for cmake projects, so I don't need to rewrite alot of the boiler plate code necessary for the build system.

Feel free to pull it, remove the .git file and use the template for whatever project you need. I just really hate having to rewrite the same code over and over again when I lose interest in one project and want to start another.

If you see anything wrong, or see a better way to organize the build system, please feel free to submit a pull request, I'll definetly accept any feedback.
